# CC_LAB2_Monolithic_Architecture
This repository contains a FastAPI-based monolithic application developed as part of Lab 2 to demonstrate the characteristics of monolithic architecture. The application includes user registration, login, event listing, checkout, and my-events modules implemented within a single codebase and deployed as one unit.

The lab demonstrates:
Single point of failure in monolithic applications
Recovery after fixing a faulty module
Load testing using Locust
Performance comparison before and after optimization

The project also includes load testing scripts for /checkout, /events, and /my-events routes, with performance analysis based on response time and request throughput.
